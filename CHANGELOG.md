# Changelog

## Version 0.8.0-alpha.2

- Building without default features does not result in compilation error. Fixed in [#111](https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/pull/112) by [@jayvdb](https://github.com/jayvdb). 

## Version 0.8.0-alpha.1

### BREAKING CHANGES
- A new [MockServer::reset](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.reset) method was added that resets a mock server. Thanks for providing the [pull request](https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/pull/100) for this feature, [@dax](https://github.com/dax).
- The default port for standalone server was changed from `5000` to `5050` due to conflicts with system services on macOS.
- [Custom matcher functions](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.When.html#method.matches) are now closures rather than functions.
- [When::json_body_partial](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.7.0/httpmock/struct.When.html#method.json_body_partial) was renamed to `json_body_includes`.
- [When::x_www_form_urlencoded_tuple](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.7.0/httpmock/struct.When.html#method.x_www_form_urlencoded) was renamed to `form_urlencoded_tuple`.
- [When::x_www_form_urlencoded_key_exists](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.7.0/httpmock/struct.When.html#method.x_www_form_urlencoded) was renamed to `form_urlencoded_key_exists`.
- Error message output has been changed for better readability (e.g., when calling `Mock::assert`).
- Custom matcher function `When::matches` has been renamed to `When::is_true`.

#### Improvements
- Record and Playback mode was added
- Many new matchers functions have been added
- Proxy Mode was added
- Website docs have been created (see https://alexliesenfeld.github.io/httpmock/)
- HTTPS support added
- Internal implementation was entirely rewritten

### Improvements
- The algorithm to find the most similar request in case of mock assertion failures has been improved.

## Version 0.7.0

- **BREAKING CHANGES**:
  - For connecting to **remote** `httpmock` servers during tests using any of the `connect` methods like
    [MockServer::connect](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect),
    [MockServer::connect_async](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect_async),
    [MockServer::connect_from_env](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect_from_env), or
    [MockServer::connect_from_env_async](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect_from_env_async), 
    you must now activate the `remote` feature. This feature is not enabled by default.

- Improvements:
  - The dependency tree has been significantly slimmed down when the `remote` feature is not enabled.
  - If the new `remote` feature is not enabled, `httpmock` no longer has a dependency on a real HTTP client. 
    As a result, certain [TLS issues previously reported by users](https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/issues/82) 
    should no longer arise.

- This release also updates all dependencies to the most recent version.
- The minimum Rust version has been bumped to 1.70.

## Version 0.6.8

- This is a maintenance release that updates all dependencies to the most recent version.
- Fixes some dependency issues with the Docker image.

## Version 0.6.6

- Extended some API methods to allow for more type flexibility (see <https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/issues/58>). Thanks to [@95th](https://github.com/95th) for providing the PR!
- Fixed parsing query parameter values that contain `+` to represent space (see <https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/issues/56>). Thanks to [@95th](https://github.com/95th) for providing the PR!
- Added a new Cargo feature `cookie` to shorten compile time (see <https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/pull/63>). Thanks to [mythmon](https://github.com/mythmon) for providing this PR!

## Version 0.6.5

- Fixes a race condition that could occur when deleting mocks from the mock server (see <https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/issues/53>).
- Replaced internal diff library (switched from `difference` to `similar`, see <https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/pull/55>).

  [Then](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.5.8/httpmock/struct.When.html) structures. Both types are now exported again.
  Please refer to <https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/issues/47> for more info.

## Version 0.6.1

- This is a maintenance release that updates all dependencies to the most recent version.

## Version 0.6.0

### General

- Old [Mock](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.4.5/httpmock/struct.Mock.html) structure based API was deprecated
  starting from version 0.5.0 and was removed with this version. Please switch to the new API based on the
  [When](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.5.8/httpmock/struct.When.html) /
  [Then](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.5.8/httpmock/struct.When.html) structures.
- The two methods `MockRef::times_called` and `MockRef::times_called_async` were deprecated since version 0.5.0 and
  have now been removed.
- A [prelude module](https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock#getting-started) was added to shorten imports
  that are usually required when using `httpmock` in tests.
- The struct `MockRef` has been renamed to `Mock`.
- Trait `MockRefExt` has been renamed to `MockExt`.
- Added support for x-www-form-urlencoded request bodies.

### Standalone Mock Server

- Standalone server now has a request history limit that can be adjusted.
- All standalone servers parameters now have an environment variable fallback.
- Standalone servers `exposed` and `disable_access_log` parameters were changed, so that they now require a value
  in addition to the flag itself (this is due to a limitation of `structopt`/`clap`):
  Before: `httpmock --expose`, Now: `httpmock --expose true`.

## Version 0.5.8

- A bug has been fixed that prevented to use the mock server for requests containing a `multipart/form-data`
  request body with binary data.

## Version 0.5.7

- Added static mock support based on YAML files for standalone mode.
- Dockerfile Rust version has been fixed.
- Documentation on query parameters has been enhanced.
- Bumped minimum Rust version to 1.46 due to transitive dependency.

## Version 0.5.6

- A bug has been fixed that caused false positive warnings in the log output.
- Updated all dependencies to the most recent versions.
- Assertion error messages (`MockRef::assert` and `MockRef::assert_hits`) now contain more details.

## Version 0.5.5

- A bug has been fixed that prevented to use a request body in DELETE requests.

## Version 0.5.4

not required functionality.

## Version 0.5.3

- This is a maintenance release that updates all dependencies to the most recent version.
- This release bumps the minimal Rust version from 1.43+ to 1.45+.

## Version 0.5.2

## Version 0.5.1

- Updated dependency to futures-util to fix compile errors.
- Fixed all dependency version numbers to avoid future problems with new dependency version releases.

## Version 0.5.0

- ❌ _**Breaking Change**_: Function `Mock::return_json_body` was renamed to `return_json_body_obj`.
- 🚀 _**Attention**: A new API for mock definition was added. The old API is still available and functional,
but is deprecated from now on. Please consider switching to the new API._
