# Changelog

## Version 0.7.1

- Internal mock server implementation is now based on hyper 1.1.
- This release also updates all other dependencies to the most recent version.
- A new [MockServer::reset](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.reset) method was added that resets a mock server. Thanks for providing the [pull request](https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/pull/100) for this feature, [@dax](https://github.com/dax).  

## Version 0.7.0

- **BREAKING CHANGES**:
  - For connecting to **remote** `httpmock` servers during tests using any of the `connect` methods like
    [MockServer::connect](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect),
    [MockServer::connect_async](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect_async),
    [MockServer::connect_from_env](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect_from_env), or
    [MockServer::connect_from_env_async](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect_from_env_async), 
    you must now activate the `remote` feature. This feature is not enabled by default.

- Improvements:
  - The dependency tree has been significantly slimmed down when the `remote` feature is not enabled.
  - If the new `remote` feature is not enabled, `httpmock` no longer has a dependency on a real HTTP client. 
    As a result, certain [TLS issues previously reported by users](https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/issues/82) 
    should no longer arise.

- This release also updates all dependencies to the most recent version.
- The minimum Rust version has been bumped to 1.70.

- Added a new Cargo feature `cookie` to shorten compile time (see <https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock/pull/63>). Thanks to [mythmon](https://github.com/mythmon) for providing this PR!

## Version 0.6.5

- This is a maintenance release that updates all dependencies to the most recent version.

## Version 0.6.0

### General

- Old [Mock](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.4.5/httpmock/struct.Mock.html) structure based API was deprecated
  starting from version 0.5.0 and was removed with this version. Please switch to the new API based on the
  [When](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.5.8/httpmock/struct.When.html) /
  [Then](https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.5.8/httpmock/struct.When.html) structures.
- The two methods `MockRef::times_called` and `MockRef::times_called_async` were deprecated since version 0.5.0 and
  have now been removed.
- A [prelude module](https://github.com/alexliesenfeld/httpmock#getting-started) was added to shorten imports
  that are usually required when using `httpmock` in tests.
- The struct `MockRef` has been renamed to `Mock`.
- Trait `MockRefExt` has been renamed to `MockExt`.
- Added support for x-www-form-urlencoded request bodies.

### Standalone Mock Server

- Standalone server now has a request history limit that can be adjusted.
- All standalone servers parameters now have an environment variable fallback.
- Standalone servers `exposed` and `disable_access_log` parameters were changed, so that they now require a value
  in addition to the flag itself (this is due to a limitation of `structopt`/`clap`):
  Before: `httpmock --expose`, Now: `httpmock --expose true`.

## Version 0.5.8

- A bug has been fixed that prevented to use the mock server for requests containing a `multipart/form-data`
  request body with binary data.

## Version 0.5.7

- Added static mock support based on YAML files for standalone mode.
- Dockerfile Rust version has been fixed.
- Documentation on query parameters has been enhanced.
- Bumped minimum Rust version to 1.46 due to transitive dependency.

## Version 0.5.6

- A bug has been fixed that caused false positive warnings in the log output.
- Updated all dependencies to the most recent versions.
- Assertion error messages (`MockRef::assert` and `MockRef::assert_hits`) now contain more details.

## Version 0.5.5

- A bug has been fixed that prevented to use a request body in DELETE requests.

## Version 0.5.4

- A new extension trait `MockRefExt` was added that extends the `MockRef` structure with additional but usually
not required functionality.

## Version 0.5.3

- This is a maintenance release that updates all dependencies to the most recent version.
- This release bumps the minimal Rust version from 1.43+ to 1.45+.

## Version 0.5.2

- Updated dependencies to newest version.
- Removed dependency version fixation from v0.5.1.
- `Mock::return_body_from_file` and `Then::body_from_file` now accept absolute and relative file paths.

## Version 0.5.1

- Updated dependency to futures-util to fix compile errors.
- Fixed all dependency version numbers to avoid future problems with new dependency version releases.

## Version 0.5.0

- ‚ùå _**Breaking Change**_: Function `Mock::expect_json_body` was renamed to `expect_json_body_obj`.
- ‚ùå _**Breaking Change**_: Function `Mock::return_json_body` was renamed to `return_json_body_obj`.
- üöÄ _**Attention**: A new API for mock definition was added. The old API is still available and functional,
but is deprecated from now on. Please consider switching to the new API._
- üöÄ **Attention**: The following new assertion functions have been added that will provide you smart and helpful
error output to support debugging:
  - `MockRef::assert`
  - `MockRef::assert_hits`
  - `MockRef::assert_async`
  - `MockRef::assert_hits_async`
- The two methods `MockRef::times_called` and `MockRef::times_called_async` are now deprecated. Consider using

  - `When::json_body`
  - `Then::json_body`
