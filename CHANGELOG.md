## Version 0.5.0
- ❌ _**Breaking Change**_: Function `Mock::expect_json_body` was renamed to `expect_json_body_obj`.
- ❌ _**Breaking Change**_: Function `Mock::return_json_body` was renamed to `return_json_body_obj`.
- 🚀 _**Attention**: A new API for mock definition was added. The old API is still available. No changes required on your side!_
- Most API methods now accept `Into<T>` trait bounds (such as `Into<String>`) instead of concrete types (such as `&str`).
- The two methods `Mock::return_body` and `Then::body` now accept binary content.
- The new following methods which take a `serde_json::Value` as an argument:
    - `Mock::expect_json_body`
    - `Mock::return_json_body`
    - `When::json_body`
    - `Then::json_body`
- Improved documentation (a lot!).
- Debug log output is now pretty printed!
- Cookie matching support.
- Support for convenient temporary and permanent redirect.
- The log level of some log messages was changed from `debug` to `trace` to make debugging easier.

## Version 0.4.5
- Improved documentation.
- Added a new function `base_url` to the `MockServer` structure.
