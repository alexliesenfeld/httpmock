## Features

* Mocks responses from HTTP services
* Simple, expressive, fluent API.
* Many built-in helpers for easy request matching ([Regex](https://docs.rs/regex/), JSON, [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde), cookies, and more).
* Record and Playback third-party services
* Forward and Proxy Mode
* HTTPS support
* Fault and network delay simulation.
* Custom request matchers.
* Standalone mode with an accompanying [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/httpmock/httpmock).
* Helpful error messages
* [Advanced verification and debugging support](https://alexliesenfeld.github.io/posts/mocking-http--services-in-rust/#creating-mocks) (including diff generation between actual and expected HTTP request values)
* Parallel test execution.
* Fully asynchronous core with synchronous and asynchronous APIs.
* Support for [mock configuration using YAML files](https://github.com/httpmock/httpmock/tree/master#file-based-mock-specification).

## Getting Started

Add `httpmock` to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
httpmock = "0.8.0"
```

You can then use `httpmock` as follows:

```rust
use httpmock::prelude::*;

// Start a lightweight mock server.
let server = MockServer::start();

// Create a mock on the server.
let mock = server.mock(|when, then| {
    when.method(GET)
        .path("/translate")
        .query_param("word", "hello");
    then.status(200)
        .header("content-type", "text/html; charset=UTF-8")
        .body("hola");
});

// Send an HTTP request to the mock server. This simulates your code.
let response = isahc::get(server.url("/translate?word=hello")).unwrap();

// Ensure the specified mock was called exactly one time (or fail with a
// detailed error description).
mock.assert();

// Ensure the mock server did respond as specified.
assert_eq!(response.status(), 200);
```

The above example will spin up a lightweight HTTP mock server and configure it to respond to all `GET` requests
to path `/translate` with query parameter `word=hello`. The corresponding HTTP response will contain the text body
`hola`.

When the specified expectations do not match the received request, `mock.assert()` fails the test with a detailed error description, 
including a diff that shows the differences between the expected and actual HTTP requests. Example:

```bash
0 of 1 expected requests matched the mock specification.
Here is a comparison with the most similar unmatched request (request number 1):

------------------------------------------------------------
1 : Query Parameter Mismatch
------------------------------------------------------------
Expected:
    key    [equals]  word
    value  [equals]  hello-rustaceans

Received (most similar query parameter):
    word=hello

All received query parameter values:
    1. word=hello

Matcher:  query_param
Docs:     https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.8.0/httpmock/struct.When.html#method.query_param
```

# Usage

See the [official website](http://httpmock.rs) for detailed API documentation.

## Examples

You can find examples in the
[`httpmock` test directory](https://github.com/httpmock/httpmock/blob/master/tests/).
The [official website](http://httpmock.rs) and [reference docs](https://docs.rs/httpmock/) also contain _**a lot**_ of examples.
