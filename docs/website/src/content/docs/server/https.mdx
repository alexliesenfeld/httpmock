By default, `httpmock` does not enable HTTPS support for testing. However, you can enable it on demand by using the
Cargo feature `https`. When this feature is enabled, `httpmock` automatically uses HTTPS for all internal communication
between the Rust API and the mock server, whether it’s a remote standalone server or a local
[`MockServer`](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html) instance.
It also allows your client to send HTTPS requests to the mock server.

## Unified Port
`httpmock` uses a unified port approach for both HTTP and HTTPS communication. This means you don’t need to change
the port or modify anything in your Rust tests to switch to HTTPS. Your client can send requests using HTTPS as needed,
and `httpmock` will automatically detect HTTPS traffic on the port and transition from HTTP to HTTPS without
any additional configuration.

## CA Certificate
Since HTTPS requires the use of certificates, you'll need to accept the `httpmock` CA certificate
in your client settings or, more conveniently, in your system preferences when using HTTPS.
You can find the `httpmock` CA certificate in the `httpmock`
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/httpmock/httpmock/blob/master/certs) (ca.pem file).


`httpmock` uses its CA certificate to generate domain-specific certificates for your tests. For instance, if you want
to mock requests from https://wikipedia.org (such as when using the `httpmock` proxy feature), the mock server
will generate and cache a certificate for that domain based on the `httpmock` CA certificate. Since your system
trusts the CA certificate, the self-signed, domain-specific certificate for Wikipedia will also be trusted
automatically.

### Trusting the CA Certificate

Here is how you can add the `httpmock` CA crtificate to your system.

#### MacOS

```bash
# Download the CA certificate
curl -o httpmock-ca.crt https://github.com/httpmock/httpmock/raw/master/certs/ca.pem

# Open Keychain Access manually or use the open command
open /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\ Access.app

# Import the certificate:
# - Drag the downloaded 'httpmock-ca.crt' file into the "System" keychain.
# - Set the certificate to "Always Trust" under "Get Info".
```

#### Windows
```
# Download the CA certificate
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/httpmock/httpmock/raw/master/certs/ca.pem" -OutFile "C:\Path\To\httpmock-ca.crt"

# Open the Certificate Manager
# Press 'Win + R', type 'mmc', and press Enter.

# Import the certificate:
# - In MMC, go to File > Add/Remove Snap-in, select "Certificates", and click "Add".
# - Choose "Computer account" and then "Local computer".
# - Under "Trusted Root Certification Authorities", right-click on "Certificates" and choose "All Tasks > Import".
# - Browse to the downloaded 'httpmock-ca.crt' file and complete the import wizard.
```

#### Ubuntu
```bash
# Clone the repository to get the CA certificate
git clone git@github.com:httpmock/httpmock.git

# Copy the certificate to the system's trusted certificates directory
sudo cp httpmock/certs/ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/httpmock.crt

# Update the system's trusted certificates
sudo update-ca-certificates
```
