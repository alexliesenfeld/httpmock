## Test Failure Output

When your tests don't send the expected data, `httpmock` tries to provide as much information as possible about what
exactly is missing or different. However, to see details about unmet expectations, you need to use one of the
following assertion methods:

- [Mock::assert](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.Mock.html#method.assert) / [Mock::assert_async](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.Mock.html#method.assert_async)
- [Mock::assert_calls](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.Mock.html#method.assert_calls) / [Mock::assert_calls_async](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.Mock.html#method.assert_calls_async)

Let's have a look at an example:
```rust
#[test]
fn getting_started_testxx() {
    use httpmock::prelude::*;

    // Start a lightweight mock server.
    let server = MockServer::start();

    // Create a mock on the server.
    let hello_mock = server.mock(|when, then| {
        when.method("GET")
            .path("/translate")
            .query_param("word", "hello-rustaceans");
        then.status(200)
            .header("content-type", "text/html; charset=UTF-8")
            .body("hola");
    });

    // Send an HTTP request to the mock server. This simulates your code.
    let response = reqwest::blocking::get(server.url("/translate?word=hello"))
        .unwrap();

    // Ensure the specified mock was called. This will fail and print output
    // with an explanation of what was expected and provided.
    hello_mock.assert();
}
```

Notice how `mock.assert()` is used to verify that the mock you defined earlier has been called **exactly once**.
If you expect a different number of calls, use [Mock::assert_calls](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.Mock.html#method.assert_calls).

Since the path of the request that was actually sent to the mock server differs from the expected one,
`hello_mock.assert()` will panic and cause the test to fail with the following message:

```bash
0 of 1 expected requests matched the mock specification.
Here is a comparison with the most similar unmatched request (request number 1):

------------------------------------------------------------
1 : Query Parameter Mismatch
------------------------------------------------------------
Expected:
    key    [equals]  word
    value  [equals]  hello-rustaceans

Received (most similar query parameter):
    word=hello

All received query parameter values:
    1. word=hello

Matcher:  query_param
Docs:     https://docs.rs/httpmock/0.8.0-alpha.1/httpmock/struct.When.html#method.query_param
```

## Logs

`httpmock` logs through the log crate, so you can see detailed log output about its behavior.
This output is useful for investigating issues, like figuring out why a request doesn't match a mock definition.

The debug log level is usually the most helpful, but you can use trace to get even more details.

    To see the log output during test execution, add the `--nocapture` argument when running your tests.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
    If you're using the `env_logger` backend, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `httpmock=debug`
    to see `httpmock` logs.
