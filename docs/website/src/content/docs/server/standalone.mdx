You can use `httpmock` to run a standalone mock server in a separate process, such as a Docker container.
This setup allows the mock server to be accessible to multiple applications, not just within your Rust tests.
Itâ€™s particularly useful for system or end-to-end tests that require mocked services.

By deploying `httpmock` as an independent service, it becomes available outside of Rust tests, providing
fake responses for services that are unavailable for testing.

Even when a mock server is running outside your Rust tests in a separate process, such as a Docker container,
you can still use it within your Rust tests just like a local MockServer instance
(see [Connecting to Standalone Mock Servers](#connecting-to-standalone-mock-servers)). This enables your Rust tests
to set up remote, standalone servers for larger, federated end-to-end test scenarios, with your Rust tests
acting as the test runner.

With this feature, `httpmock` can be used as universal HTTP mocking tool that is useful in all stages
of the development lifecycle.

## Running Standalone Mock Servers

### Docker Image
Although you can build the mock server in standalone mode yourself, it is easiest to use the accompanying
[Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/httpmock/httpmock) hosted on Docker Hub.

You can run it as follows:
```bash
docker run httpmock/httpmock
````

#### Build Docker Image

If you want to build the Docker image yourself, you can clone the `httpmock` GitHub repository and
build it yourself using the Dockerfile that is contained in the project root directory:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:httpmock/httpmock.git

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t my-httpmock-image .

# Start a Docker container
docker run my-httpmock-image
````

### Build Binary
Alternatively, you can clone the GitHub repository and build a binary from the projects root directory
and execute it as follows:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:httpmock/httpmock.git

# Build a standalone mock server binary
cargo build --release --all-features

# Execute the binary
./target/release/httpmock
```

### Environment Variables

Please refer to the [Environment Variables](/getting_started/fundamentals/#environment-variables) section for information what environment variables are available when
using a standalone mock server.

## Connecting to Standalone Mock Servers

To be able to use the standalone server from within your tests, you need to change how an instance of the MockServer
instance is created. Instead of using [`MockServer::start`](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.start),
you need to connect to a remote server by using one of the `connect` methods (such as
[`MockServer::connect`](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect) or
[`MockServer::connect_from_env`](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.connect_from_env)).
Note: These are only available with the remote feature enabled.

## Sequential Test Execution

To prevent interference with other tests, only one test function can use the remote server at the same time.
This means that test functions may be blocked when connecting to the remote server until it becomes free again.
This is in contrast to tests that use a local mock server where parallel test execution is possible, because
each test uses its own mock server.

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
    Sequential execution is only enforced on a per-process basis. This means that if multiple test runs or
    applications use the remote server simultaneously, interference may still occur.
</Aside>

## Usage Without Rust

You can use a standalone mock server independently, without needing Rust to configure mock behavior. `httpmock` allows
you to define mocks using YAML files, which follow a similar when/then pattern as the Rust API. Here's an example
that defines two mocks (mock definitions are separated using the triple dash separator):

```yaml
when:
  method: GET
  path: /static-mock/examples/simple
then:
  status: 200
  json_body: '{ "response" : "hello" }'
---
when:
  method: POST
  path: /static-mock/examples/submit
then:
  status: 201
  json_body: '{ "status" : "created" }'
```

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
    Defining mocks with YAML files is straightforward because the field names directly match the corresponding
    methods in the Rust API, found in the [`When`](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.When.html) or
    [`Then`](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.Then.html) data structures.

which includes many of the usable fields.
