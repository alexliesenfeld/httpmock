After creating a recording, you can replay it by loading it into a mock server instance using the
`httpmock` Rust API as follows:

```rust
// ...

// Save the recording to
// "target/httpmock/recordings/github-torvalds-scenario_<timestamp>.yaml".
let target_path = recording
    .save("github-torvalds-scenario")
    .expect("cannot store scenario on disk");

let playback_server = MockServer::start();

// Play back the recorded interactions from the file.
playback_server.playback(target_path);
```

After calling [`MockServer::playback`](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.playback),
the recording will be loaded into the mock server. This allows all previously recorded requests to act as matching
criteria, similar to how you configure normal mocks using
[`MockServer::mock`](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.MockServer.html#method.mock) with the
[`When`](https://docs.rs/httpmock/latest/httpmock/struct.When.html) structure.

Hereafter, whenever the mock server receives a request that matches any of the recorded requests, it will
respond with the corresponding recorded response.

## Full Example
The following example demonstrates how you can use the forwarding feature to record and playback
requests sent to the GitHub API and the responses it returns.
