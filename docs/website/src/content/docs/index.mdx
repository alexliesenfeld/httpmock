	<Card title="Mock HTTP Services" icon="pencil">
		If you call HTTP services or APIs in your application, `httpmock` makes it **easy** to mock their responses in your tests.
	</Card>
    <Card title="Advanced Features" icon="open-book">
        `httpmock` offers a range of advanced features, including **record and playback**, **proxy mode**, **standalone mode**, **HTTPS support**, **sharing mocks**, and many more.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Record and Playback" icon="add-document">
        **Record requests** and responses when interacting with a real service and **play them back** in your tests.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Library and Standalone Server" icon="setting">
        `httpmock` is a **Rust testing library**, but it also includes a **standalone server** that runs in a separate process, such as a Docker container.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Useful Debugging Tools" icon="open-book">
        One of the primary goals of `httpmock` is to be **actually helpful** by explaining the reasons when tests fail. It comes with useful logging, error messages, and an advanced request comparison algorithm.
    </Card>
	<Card title="Create and Share Mocks" icon="add-document">
		`httpmock` allows you to **create and share mocked responses** using YAML-files.
	</Card>
    <Card title="Flexible Request Matching" icon="open-book">
        Includes an **extensive set of built-in matchers** that let you define rules for matching requests based on method, path, headers, query parameters, body, and more, or use **custom matchers** for complex matching logic.
    </Card>
